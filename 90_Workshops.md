# PART A - 'SOFT SKILLS'

### 1. GROWTH MINDSET

      FIXED MS.             VS            GROWTH MS.

    Born skills             VS          Built skills
    Focus on results        VS          Focus on process
    Avoid Failure           VS          Failure is an opportunity (to learn)
    Effort is unncessary    VS          Effort improves ourself

**In general:**
- Be open-mindend  
- Capability to change  
- Admit mistakes  
- Be brave  
- Get out of comfort zone  

**How to give feedback:**
- Say positive first  
- Be constructive  
- Bring up an example  

### 2. TIME MANAGEMENT

- 2 minute rule: If you can do it in 2 minutes, do it NOW
- procrastination:
    - Future self - can set goals and plan
    - Present self - only Present self can take ACTION

    - The problem is starting the task, not doing it, so focus on this and make it as easy as possible to get started

    - Strategies:
        1. Connect task with something you love (eg. only listen to your favourite music when you go running)
        2. Make effects of procrastination more immediate (eg. skipping workout is not an issue in the moment, but if you have to pay if you skip it, it becomes more painful in the moment)
        3. Design your future action ahead (eg fill the fridge with exacly you want to eat that week)
        4. Make the task more achievable (prepare your running kit the day before)
        5. Make the task more achievable (break it down to smaller, more achievable steps)

### 3. HOW TO GIVE FEEDBACK

- Focus on the positive feedaback (helps against burnout)
    "Catch someone doing something well!"
- Understand that the feedback is for you to be better
- "Opinion based": start with "In my opinion...", "For me...", "I think that..."
- Get to know your blindspots
    - Others will be able to see you better (from a different angle)

- In real life: understanding the brief of a project (the later we discuss, the more expensive the change will be)
    - Feedback from client
    - Feedback to teammates
    
- How to give feedback:
    - Focus on the positive
    - Be specific
    - Offer alternative
    - Behaviour based: Don't judge the personality, but focus on the specific behaviour in a situation
    - Expanded: Get into details for a better understanding

- STOP DOING / START DOING / KEEP DOING

- Receiving feedback:
    - Assume that the other wants to improve you
    - Thank the feedback, it's not to offend you!

- Profession specific:
    - Pull requests:
        - Identify errors
        - Suggest simplification
        - Asking for explanation
        - Debate coding style
        - Brainstorming

**SMART goals:**
- **Specific:** Goals should be well-defined and clear. Instead of having a vague goal, it should be detailed. For example, rather than saying "I want to get fit," a specific goal would be "I want to be able to run 5 kilometers without stopping."
- **Measurable:** There should be concrete criteria for measuring progress towards the attainment of the goal. This helps in staying on track and meeting deadlines. For instance, if your goal is to save money, a measurable goal would be "I want to save $5000 by the end of the year."
- **Achievable:** Goals should be realistic and attainable. While they can be challenging, they shouldn't be so extreme that they're unattainable. It's about finding the balance between challenging yourself and setting a goal that is within reach given your current resources and constraints.
- **Relevant:** The goal should matter to you and align with other relevant goals. It's important that the goal actually contributes to broader objectives and is relevant to your interests, needs, and abilities.
- **Time-bound:** Every goal needs a target date, so that there is a deadline to focus on and something to work toward. This part of the SMART goal criteria helps to prevent everyday tasks from taking priority over your longer-term goals.

- Focus on the **PROCESS** or a **SYSTEM**, not the GOALS, to achieve your **GOALS**

- **Relation between habits and motivation:**
    - Habits, both conscious and hidden, significantly influence our motivation levels:
        - Conscious habits require active input to maintain
        - Hidden habits operate on autopilot and are often unnoticed.
    - Motivation is not a simple on/off switch but a flow that includes support, surface recognition, and a core purpose.
    - Having a clear purpose, which provides meaning and forward movement, is crucial for sustaining motivation. 

- **2 types of habits:**
    - **Concious:**
        - These are habits that we are actively aware of and deliberately work on
        - They require intentional effort and decision-making
        - For example, setting a specific time for exercise each day or dedicating an hour to reading before bed are conscious habits.
        - Since these habits demand more active input and self-control, they can be directly influenced by our motivation levels.
    - **Unconcious/Hidden:**
        - Also known as unconscious or automatic habits, these are behaviors that we perform without much thought, often because they have been deeply ingrained over time.
        - These habits can include things like our posture, the way we react in certain situations, or routine actions we do every day.
        - Hidden habits operate more on autopilot and can significantly influence our lives without our immediate awareness.

- **The connection between these two types of habits and motivation is significant:**
    - **Influence of Conscious Habits on Motivation:** 
        - When you actively work on conscious habits, especially those aligned with your goals and values, they can boost your motivation. 
        - Successfully maintaining a conscious habit can give you a sense of achievement and progress, which fuels further motivation.
    - **Influence of Hidden Habits on Motivation:** 
        - Hidden habits can either positively or negatively affect your motivation. 
            - **Positive hidden habits** like automatically organizing your workspace, can create an environment that fosters motivation.
            - **Negative hidden habits** such as procrastination or automatically reaching for unhealthy snacks, can hinder your motivation and progress towards your goals.

# PART B - 'TECHNICALS'

### 1. CHATGPT

- **Workshop**
- **SI week**
    - There are many advantages, but you also need to keep in mind, that:
        - Provide incomplete or inaccurate information (also makes things up sometimes!)
        - Lack of human intuition
        - Be aware of becoming too dependent on AI - it can cause you thinking you know much
        - Ethical and privacy concerns: reuse of other data (it's not always generated by ChatGPT)
    
    - ELI5 - "Explain Like I'm 5"

### 2. ALGORITHMIC THINKING

### 3. DEBUGGING

- Debugging: find what causes the error
- Rules:
    - Understand the system *(understand what your code is trying to do)*
    - Make it fail *(when do you encounter the error?)*
    - Quit thinking and look *(look at the code, and not just assume what you think you wrote)*
    - Divide and Conquer *(split into small pieces and log each step, to see where it fails)*
        - This also refers to bug finding with the halving method (split code in half, then test it for both sides. Keep doing it on the side you find the bug on)
    - **Change ONE thing at a time!**
    - Check the plug *(does everything work as intended?)*
    - Get a fresh view *(stand up and make a break, or show it to someone else)*
    - If you didn't fix it, it's not fixed *(it might work in 99% of cases, but not always)*

- Tools & Techniques:
    - **Rubber Duck:** *explain your code to someone, even if it's not a real person (hence the rubber duck)*  
        - It's very likely that you will find the mistake yourself
    - **Print & Trace** *log your progress (same as divide & conquer)*
    - **DEBUGGER:** (in VS code or in browser)
        1. F5 - Start debugging -> starts a new debug console
        2. it runs the code, so in order to stop it, you need to add ***breakpoints*** to the code (red dots)
        3. After it srops you can use the icons to navigate the code (step into - works with functions!)
        > **The selected line is not executed yet!**  
        > **Side panel:** You can check here the progress of the code as it updates from line to line  
        > **Watch:** You can trace expressions here (type in the name and :)
    - Debug in browser - click on sources tab, and then on the file you are debugging (then the same process)

### 4. GIT & GITHUB - PULL REQUEST

    review of basic commands & pull request method was learned

### 5. AGILE & SCRUM
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X1iES5VSVvpTmb8kaNU1P38ikbgOPUpQH27Z9DjMC8E/edit#heading=h.16im0yasoixh

    Agilis fejlesztes - rugalmasan igazodunk a valtozasokhoz (pl uj programnyelv) -> a metoduson van a hangsuly

    SCRUM - elorehaladas ciklikusan
        - iterations / sprints:
            - 2-4 week periods
            - BUILD - MEASURE - LEARN:
                - development / coding
                - get early feedback concept
                - learn and refactor for next loop
        - Backlog (a list of future tasks):
            - a list created after the LEARN phase, which includes all the elements required to improve the product / project
            - an element is a single project unit, that can be assigned to developers
            - derived from the roadmap and its requirements
            - items in priority order
        - The smallest elements of the task (=subtasks) are called epics or user stories (sg that can be done in under 1 day)
    
    GITHUB PROJECTS
        - A tool for team management
        - Independent from repos, but repos can be assigned (uses tags, so very lightweight) -> users need to be added to both the repo AND the project!
        - Can create tickets and assign people to them
        - Can create project timeline
