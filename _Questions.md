# Questions:  

If I have a class, that uses multiple interfaces, and I use that as a dependency, can I initialize it as a class?       // TW2 task example
    (otherwise there is no interface I can create, because they are all partial interfaces of the class)

Unit testing project: dependencies in test class - I created them in the refactored section - Is this the correct way? 

mocking - the process explained ( https://journey.study/v2/learn/materials/mocking-csharp-1q2023 )

what is the difference between using a [SetUp] method or a constuctor, to create initial members?
