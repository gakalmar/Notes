# Questions:  


// INTERFACES

1. If I have a class, that uses multiple interfaces, and I use that as a dependency, can I initialize it as a class?
    (otherwise there is no interface I can create, because they are all partial interfaces of the class)
    `Ehotelbuffet task` or `SeasonalProductDiscounter` in SI3


// FILE LOGGER

2. What is sync and async reading?


// EXCEPTION HANDLING / TRY-CATCH BLOCKS

When to start using this?

# SI week summary

- **Unit testing** - basics are clear, but still need to practice using mocking
    - Crashtest - all good
    - BonusInTheAir 
        - how is refactring done? (directory structure not clear)
        - how to create tests for both legacy code and refactored?
        - why are bonuses in a list (I refacrored it to a single bonus rule)
        - Health Risk - not completed yet
- **LINQ**
    - Seasonal Product discounter - very good to use (but testing was the same calculations...)
- **File handling** - the use of StreamReader / Writer needs a bit more practice; accessing directories methodology unclear
    - Language interationalization - chaining LINQ methods was very useful, but when to convert types is still a bit unclear
    - Down the rabbit hole - useful for our weekly task as far as I remember?
