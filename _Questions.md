1. If I have a class, that uses multiple interfaces, and I use that as a dependency, can I initialize it as a class?
    (otherwise there is no interface I can create, because they are all partial interfaces of the class)
    `Ehotelbuffet task` or `SeasonalProductDiscounter` in SI3


// FILE LOGGER

2. What is sync and async reading?


// EXCEPTION HANDLING / TRY-CATCH BLOCKS

When to start using this?
