# Questions:  

### 1 Div within div

- Adding many elements to a webpage: Do we create sub-divs or is it better to just list all elements on after another? (Product list vs Movie DB)

### 2 Sync & async reading

- When do we use sync & async reading methods?
- Best practice for async? (Is try required as in team task, or is it enough to have it like in the product list file?)
