### 1 Hops and Hofs

Is import not needed, because we read the data.js file in the HEAD component in HTML?

### 2 Hops and Hofs

Is there a way to create a function, and when it's called on a different scope, it can still see some variables within the scope?
(I tried to create a diplay beers function, but it didn't see the section element in the DOM) - marked with //? in the file

### 3 Hops and Hofs

How can I toggle a buttons functionality? (In the task I'm using classes, and check if it contains it or not)

### 4

Issue with button clicks -> it seems to be counting the clicks, but only takes action after clicking on another item
- click on load beers
- then click on sort by score a couple of times
- then on the strong IPAs button -> it will display reset button a lot of times
