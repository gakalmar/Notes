# PART A - 'SOFT SKILLS'

### 1. GROWTH MINDSET

      FIXED MS.             VS            GROWTH MS.

    Born skills             VS          Built skills
    Focus on results        VS          Focus on process
    Avoid Failure           VS          Failure is an opportunity (to learn)
    Effort is unncessary    VS          Effort improves ourself

**In general:**
- Be open-mindend  
- Capability to change  
- Admit mistakes  
- Be brave  
- Get out of comfort zone  

**How to give feedback:**
- Say positive first  
- Be constructive  
- Bring up an example  

### 2. TIME MANAGEMENT

# PART B - 'TECHNICALS'

### 1. CHATGPT 

### 2. ALGORITHMIC THINKING

### 3. DEBUGGING

- Debugging: find what causes the error
- Rules:
    - Understand the system *(understand what your code is trying to do)*
    - Make it fail *(when do you encounter the error?)*
    - Quit thinking and look *(look at the code, and not just assume what you think you wrote)*
    - Divide and Conquer *(split into small pieces and log each step, to see where it fails)*
        - This also refers to bug finding with the halving method (split code in half, then test it for both sides. Keep doing it on the side you find the bug on)
    - **Change ONE thing at a time!**
    - Check the plug *(does everything work as intended?)*
    - Get a fresh view *(stand up and make a break, or show it to someone else)*
    - If you didn't fix it, it's not fixed *(it might work in 99% of cases, but not always)*

- Tools & Techniques:
    - **Rubber Duck:** *explain your code to someone, even if it's not a real person (hence the rubber duck)*  
        - It's very likely that you will find the mistake yourself
    - **Print & Trace** *log your progress (same as divide & conquer)*
    - **DEBUGGER:** (in VS code or in browser)
        1. F5 - Start debugging -> starts a new debug console
        2. it runs the code, so in order to stop it, you need to add ***breakpoints*** to the code (red dots)
        3. After it srops you can use the icons to navigate the code (step into - works with functions!)
        > **The selected line is not executed yet!**  
        > **Side panel:** You can check here the progress of the code as it updates from line to line  
        > **Watch:** You can trace expressions here (type in the name and :)
    - Debug in browser - click on sources tab, and then on the file you are debugging (then the same process)
