# This is the main heading, which is underlined

## Slightly less important heading, but still underlined

### Ok, this is still important, but not underlined anymore

#### The heading are getting smaller...

##### ...and smaller. Can you still read this?

###### This is the smallest heading. Wait, why is it smaller than baisc paragraph text?

New lines are created like this:</br>
This is a new line

Leave an empty line to start a new paragraph

Now let's do **bold text**. Awesome, how about *italic*? Even better! ***Now let's do both!*** Is this MAGIC or what?

> No let's highlight this paragraph.</br>
> This is called a **Blockquote**.
>> You can even add a nested paragraph inside it.</br>
> It can even include a list:
> - You can add things to your list
> - Like seriously important things
> - It's called an unordered list.
> - 1986\. If you want to start with a number and a dot, use the \  backslash escape character

1. If you want to create an ordered list,
2. Just do it like this...
3. Numbers followed by a dot.
4. That's simple!

* To add text under a list item like this:</br>
    Just indent the text, after a line break.
* And then you can add more items to your list.

#### Now let's see how to add some code:

To add single line code or just code keywords use the backticks: `function()`. It will display like code.

        console.log("If you indent something twice (8 whitespaces), you can add code");
        for (const item of list){
            console.log("This will be indented");
        };

        //within the code window, MD formatiing doesn't work. **See?**

#### Let's see now how to add some images:

Add an image from local library:

![Name of the image](/assets/—Pngtree—simple hand-painted wind rockets are_4067731.png)

So let's see if it displays properly?
